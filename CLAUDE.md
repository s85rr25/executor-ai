# Executor AI — Claude Instructions

## What This Is
An AI executor assistant. It parses estate documents into a live state graph, then
proactively alerts the executor *before* probate deadlines and liability triggers are
missed. The differentiator is a real **agent** — the DeadlineAgent — that reasons over
estate state against California probate law and surfaces the next action before the
executor knows to ask. Built with Claude for a 24-hour hackathon.

## Architecture at a Glance
This is a **polyglot** project — two services sharing one Redis state store. Use each
language for what it is best at; do not collapse everything into one stack.

```

- **Python (`agent/`)** owns all Claude reasoning, document parsing, embeddings, the
  agent loop, and RAG. This is the "hard AI" surface and the Anthropic-prize story.
- **TypeScript (`web/`)** owns everything the judge sees and touches, plus voice.
- **Redis** is the only thing both services talk to. It is the contract.

---

## Stack (Quick Reference)

### `agent/` — Python service (the brain)
- **Framework**: FastAPI + Uvicorn, Python 3.11+
- **AI**: Anthropic Python SDK (`anthropic`)
  - `claude-sonnet-4-6` — the model used across the whole service today: document
    parsing (vision + structured), DeadlineAgent reasoning, RAG chat, and letters.
    `agent/llm/claude.py` exposes `DOCUMENT_MODEL` and `REASONING_MODEL` (both
    `claude-sonnet-4-6`) — swap `REASONING_MODEL` to `claude-opus-4-8` if you want the
    heavier reasoning path back.
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (`openai`), 1536-dim
- **Auth**: cookie sessions with `bcrypt` password hashing (`agent/auth/`)
- **Email**: Resend for the weekly recap / alert digest (`agent/notify/email.py`)
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 for all Claude structured outputs and API schemas
- **Observability**: Phoenix tracing (`phoenix.otel.register` + OpenInference) — traces
  Anthropic, OpenAI embeddings, and the full agent loop; plus an LLM-as-judge eval
  (`agent/evals/deadline_next_steps_quality.py`)
- **Dates**: `python-dateutil` / stdlib `datetime` for all deadline arithmetic
- **Documents**: `pypdf` / `pdfplumber` for text, Claude vision for scans/images;
  `pillow` + `pillow-heif` for image/HEIC handling

### `web/` — Next.js frontend (the experience)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI (client of the agent)**: calls `agent/` over HTTP; streams chat via SSE
- **Voice**: Deepgram STT + TTS (`@deepgram/sdk`)
- **Observability**: Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`)
- **Validation**: Zod — mirrors the Pydantic contract for anything crossing the wire

### Shared
- **State + vectors**: KV holds estate state; a vector store powers RAG / agent memory
  with 1536-dimensional `text-embedding-3-small` vectors. `agent/store/redis_client.py`
  supports three interchangeable backends behind one API, selected by `STORE_BACKEND`:
  `redis_cloud` (Redis Cloud KV + Redis 8 Vector Sets — the cloud path this project runs
  on), `upstash` (Upstash Redis REST + Upstash Vector — also supported), and `memory`
  (in-process fallback for offline dev). `make`/`.env.example` default to `memory`.

## Core Data Shapes (the contract)
These shapes are defined once as **Pydantic models** in `agent/schemas/` and mirrored as
**TypeScript types + Zod schemas** in `web/`. Member 2 owns keeping the two in sync.

```
EstateState (Redis KV key: estate:{id})
  id, deceasedName, dateOfDeath (ISO), appointmentDate (ISO),
  state="california", executor{name,email},
  assets[], debts[], beneficiaries[], documents[], tasks[], alerts[],
  phase: 1..6, createdAt, updatedAt

Alert (output of DeadlineAgent)
  id, severity: critical|warning|info,
  type: deadline|liability|missing_doc|rule_violation,
  title, body, rule, daysRemaining?, actionRequired, createdAt, dismissed
```

Full field-level definitions live in [project_overview.md](project_overview.md#core-data-shapes).

## Demo Estate (Seed Data)
Estate ID `demo-milligan` | Deceased: Robert A. Milligan | Date of death: 2026-06-03 |
Appointment: 2026-06-10 | Executor: Dana Milligan. The canonical object lives in
`agent/seed/demo_estate.py` (`build_demo_estate()`); `POST /seed` resets it.

Designed to fire live during the demo (exact day counts depend on the run date):
1. **CRITICAL** — Creditors not yet notified; the 30-day certified-mail window from the
   June 10 appointment is closing.
2. **CRITICAL** — DE-160 Inventory & Appraisal outstanding with no property appraisal on
   the Berkeley home or the Honda Civic.

Full seed object: [project_overview.md](project_overview.md#demo-scenario).

---

## Critical Rules
- **Never commit `agent/.env` or `web/.env.local`.**
- Every Claude and OpenAI embedding call is traced. In Python that means it runs inside a Phoenix
  span tagged with `estate_id` and `action_type`. In the web layer, wrap the proxy call
  in a Sentry span.
- Validate **every** Claude structured output (Pydantic in `agent/`) before writing to
  Redis. Anything crossing to the browser is re-validated with Zod.
- CA probate jurisdiction only — hardcoded for the hackathon.
- Debt payment order: secured → unsecured → distributions. Out-of-order = executor
  personal liability. The DeadlineAgent must flag this.
- Never give legal advice in chat. Use: *"This requires your attorney's input — it
  involves [reason]."*
- Tone: warm and direct. Never clinical. This person is grieving.
